            		<pre>Surf in Jeffery's Bay, South Africa</pre></label><br>
	            		<p>Jeffrey's Bay is one of the world's most amazing waves. Take off at the heavily localised Boneyards section of the wave, connecting through to the Supertubes section down the line to Impossibles, Tubes, Coins and Point before lining up all the way down to the beach break called Albatross.

                        Boneyards, a full on barrel when it is on over a sucking reef, and when it's small it can be fun.

                        Supertubes, is a fast full on down the line speed section and the reason you go to J-Bay.

                        Impossibles is exactly as it's named after, impossible. Some have made it through for the mile long run through to the point but it's a rare situation. When looking at eight foot, it is a scary section of wave and is not fun when you get caught in its grips.</p>

	            		<p>Properly called “Camino a los Yungas” or “Yungas Road” the Death Road leads down from the Bolivian capital of La Paz to the town of Coroico. An average of 300 travellers lose their lives on this treacherous route each year, and the road is marked by countless crosses that mark the final resting places of the unfortunate victims of accidents. The road is only as wide as a single vehicle in most points, and the law states that any vehicle heading downhill must yield to one coming up. Adding to the confusion and danger, it is also the only road in the Americas where driving is done on the left side of the road.<br>

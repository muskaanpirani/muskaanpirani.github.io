	            		<p>Hiking up mountains and volcanoes at night is the new trend. You hike under a beautiful starry sky, away from all the light pollution of cities, and make it to the top in time for an epic sunrise. Especially in Bali, the volcano hike craze is all about Mount Batur and it’s perfect sunrises peeking through from the clouds. In this post, I’m going to talk to you about another volcano that you can easily do a trip to from Bali, with considerably fewer people around and the added plus of a unique natural phenomenon: Kawah Ijen.

                        Kawah Ijen is an active volcano in East Java, famous for its electric blue flames, the only place in the world where they are visible.</p>

	            		<p>The Shotover Canyon Swing in Queenstown, New Zealand. This swing is the world's highest cliff jump -- a death-defying drop that shoots you 360 feet into the canyon below, from a launching pad that overlooks the precipice like an ominous, suspended gargoyle. Participants latch themselves to a 650-foot cable before they careen off the pad, reaching speeds of up to 90mph in the fall before the cable catches them above the Shotover River below.

                        The adrenaline rush comes in a variety of options. If you choose to brave the swing, you can do so either freefalling, shooting off a slide, riding a small bicycle, or sitting in a plastic chair so perilous that the officials behind this thing have called the "chair of death."</p>

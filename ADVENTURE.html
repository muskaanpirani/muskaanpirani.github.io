				Adventure tourism continues to grow in its popularity, with at least 42% of all travelers wanting to participate in one or a range of adventure activities. There’s usually a lot of planning and preparation that goes into the process, and while 80% of the revenue from a typical trip goes to airlines, in adventure tourism 70-80% of the revenue goes to local communities.
				While tourism brings a wealth of benefits, when honeypot destinations overfill, their fragile environments can be seriously degraded. <br>

				Travellers are becoming empowered with knowledge about how they can be a part of the solution and, even in the smallest way, make a positive impact when they travel. Active travellers are turning to sustainable and innovative itineraries that can mitigate negative effects.

				Choosing an adventure travel company with responsible travel practices at its heart and opting for destinations away from well-trodden tourist trails helps avoid overtourism. It also gives you a better opportunity to forge greater connections with local people and their ways of life, resulting in a more authentic holiday experience.<br>

				Many people are turning to ‘off the beaten track’ destinations, the style of tourism for which we’ve been strong advocates since our first trek in Nepal in 1975. By conserving environments and cultures and supporting local communities at every level of our operations in the places we visit, our big adventures leave small footprints.<br>

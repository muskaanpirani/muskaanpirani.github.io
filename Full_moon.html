            		<pre>Full Moon Party-Koh Phangan, Thailand</pre></label><br>
	            		<p>Koh Phangan Full Moon Party is world-famous and its ancestral home is the crescent cove of Haad Rin Beach on the southernmost tip of Phangan Island in Thailand.
						It has become a tradition to paint yourself up in neon bodypaint and there are plenty of UV strip lights around making bodies sparkle and glow through the night.
						The beverage of choice is, of course, the ‘bucket’. This consists of a bottle of hard liquor usually either whiskey, vodka or local sugarcane rum like Sangsom or Hong Thong, a bottle of Red Bull and some ice, occasionally also including mixers to water it down a little.
						Koh Phangan Full Moon Party kicks off quite early in the evening, but it is highly recommended to arrive a bit late – about 10pm at the earliest – if you want to have any hope of making it through to the morning.</p>

            		<pre>Bungee Jumping, New Zealand</pre></label><br>
	            		<p>In the 1980â€™s, a couple of young kiwis, AJ Hackett and Henry van Asch, set up New Zealand's first commercial bungy jumping operation, with a jump from the historic Kawarau Bridge near Queenstown. Since then, New Zealand has become the home of bungy, with numerous other operators starting up. 

                        All over the country you can leap from bridges, climbs, rail viaducts, specially made platforms perched on the edge of cliffs, and stadium roofs.

                        The Nevis bungy is the highest and involves an incredible 134-metre plunge. You can also take a leap off the Auckland Harbour Bridge against the backdrop of the beautiful Waitemata Harbour.</p>
